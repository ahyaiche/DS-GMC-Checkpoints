    "Inside the while loop, prompt the user to select an operation symbol.\n",
    "Prompt the user to input the second number.\n",
    "Use the dictionary to retrieve the function that corresponds to the selected operation symbol and store it in a variable 'calculation_function'\n",
    "Perform the calculation by calling the 'calculation_function' on the two input numbers and store the result in a variable 'answer'.\n",
    "Print the equation and the result of the calculation.\n",

    "If the user chooses to continue, update the 'num1' variable to the value of 'answer'.\n",
    "If the user chooses to start a new calculation, set the 'should_continue' variable to false and call the 'calculator' function to start a new calculation.\n",
    "Note: Make sure to test the program with different inputs and operations to ensure that it is functioning properly."
